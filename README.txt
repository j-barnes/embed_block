Embed Block is a module that renders a block into formatted text by using a
format filter. It features a built in CKEditor plugin for easy selections of
any block.

On order to embed a block you will first need to visit
Configuration > Content Authoring > Text Formats and Editors and configure
the correct editor.

From here you can drag the "Embed Block" icon into the toolbar.
If "Limit allowed HTML" is enabled, you will need to add the
<embed-block class data-block-id> to the allowed list.
